THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED

I highly recommend that everyone switch over to https://github.com/aarzilli/golua

Go Bindings for the Lua C API (Now works on Go1!)

Simplest way to install:

$ go get -u github.com/xenith-studios/golua

To use golua:

import "github.com/xenith-studios/golua"

After installing golua, if you wish to run the examples:

$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/xenith-studios/golua/example/
$ for test in *.go; do { go run $test; } done
